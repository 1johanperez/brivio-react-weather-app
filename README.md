# brivio-react-weather-app

Brivio's front-end coding challenge!

Frontend Engineer Coding Assignment Task: Create a weather app in React using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Objective: The objective of the assignment is to display a solid understanding of the following concepts:
● React core fundamentals and clean coding principles
● Using components to decouple data from the UI
● Using routing to navigate between screens
● Accessing REST APIs to fetch and display JSON data
● Basic authentication and session management
Requirements: The app should have the following functionality
● Main screen that shows weather summary of cities that have previously been added.
Minimum fields should include:
○ Current temperature
○ Expected high and low temperatures
○ Overcast state (sunny, cloudy, etc.)
● Interface to allow user to add or remove a city.
● Detail screen of selected city that displays 5 day forecast. The following minimum fields
should be displayed in a list (or table). In addition the high and low temps should be plotted on a graph.
○ Day of week
○ High and low temperatures
○ Overcast state (sunny, cloudy, etc.)
● Bonus: A settings screen to allow the user to view the temperatures in metric (Celcius) or imperial (Fahrenheit) format.
● Bonus: Login screen with email and password. Any valid email with a password of test1234 should log you into the app. Each user should have a separate session to store app state.
● Bonus: Logout button that takes you back to the login screen.
When the user logs in for the first time, the app should recognize she has no cities added and prompt her to add her first city. Subsequent logins should show the cities she added as well as remember her temperature format setting.
While UI/UX is not the main objective, best practices should be followed to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. MaterialUI is the recommended UI framework, however, other UI frameworks are acceptable.
When finished with this assignment, please upload your project to your github profile or email us a .zip file of your project. This will allow us to review your work prior to the Technical Interview and come prepared with any questions we may have.
